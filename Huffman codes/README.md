Implementation of Huffman Codes in python. The idea was to compress and decompress text files using Huffman codes. 
The functions allow for multi-symbol compression and not just a single symbol compression, but the data given to the functions must be pre-processed.

The inspiration for implementing Huffman codes as tree structures was taken from a medium article by YaÄŸmur Cigdem Aktas. Read the original article here: https://towardsdatascience.com/huffman-encoding-python-implementation-8448c3654328
